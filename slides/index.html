# Research isn't often shared

It's often really available to the authors


---

# Why not share data?

.large[
There are indeed good reasons to not share data:

1. Privacy concerns (e.g., human subjects, locations of critically endangered species)

1. May put the authors at a competitive disadvantage ( but data can be embargoed for reasonable periods of time)
]

---

# Why not share data?

.large[
"If you can't do something right, don't do it"

- This ^^ is wrong - you **can** provide something, even if it is just simulated data.

- Sharing data (in most cases) has a net positive benefit
]

# Rowhani-Farid &amp; Barnett, 2016

.large[
Out of 160 randomly sampled BMJ papers:

- 3 included data in the paper
- 7/157 research articles shared their data sets
- For 21 clinical trials bound by the BMJ data sharing policy, 24% shared data

😭

&gt; When you approach a PI for the source codes and raw data, you better
explain who you are, whom you work for, why you need the data and
what you are going to do with it.

&gt; I have to say that this is a very unusual request without any explanation! Please ask your supervisor to send me an email with a detailed,

😢

&gt; We do not typically share our internal data or code with people outside our collaboration.

# Responses to Stodden, Seiler and Ma, 2018

.large[

😿

&gt; The code we wrote is the accumulated product of years of effort
by [redacted] and myself. Also, the data we processed was collected
painstakingly over a long period by collaborators, and so we will need
to ask permission from them too.
]

# Responses to Stodden, Seiler and Ma, 2018

.large[
😞

&gt; Normally we do not provide this kind of information to people we do
not know. It might be that you want to check the data analysis, and
that might be of some use to us, but only if you publish your findings
while properly referring to us.

# Responses to Stodden, Seiler and Ma, 2018

🙍

&gt; Thank you for your interest in our paper. For the [redacted] calculations I used my own code, and there is no public version of this code,
which could be downloaded. Since this code is not very user-friendly
and is under constant development I prefer not to share this code

&gt; If you go to [URL redacted], under the publications, I have a link
to the gitHub repository. I don’t know if I have all of the raw simulated data, but I certainly have the processed data used to make the
plots. What do you need? All of the simulated data could of course
be regenerated from the code.

# Sharing data?

.large[
Plenty of research says it is important
]

--

.large[
Fata sharing should be FAIR (findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)
]

.large[
But, unfortunately, these don't precicely tell you how to share data
]

# Why not share data?

.large.pull-left[

Socio-Culture Barriers:

- Misaligned Incentives
- Cultural Norms
- Genomics vs Clinical Trials
- Scooping

]

.large.pull-right[

Technological Barriers:

- Where to start?
- Google Drive?
- Dropbox?
- FTP?

It should instead be an "on-ramp"

It can feel like a wall or a mountain we need to climb. 

These require special tools and knowledge.

# Actually sharing the data

.large[
Now that you've created your data folder, you need to **get it somewhere online**

Two options to discuss:

1. Putting the data online
1. Sharing as an R package
]

---
class: inverse, center, middle
# Online repositories: Zenodo &amp; Dryad

---

# Zenodo

.large[
- Launched in 2013 in a joint collaboration between openAIRE and CERN
- Free, archival location to deposit datasets
- File size limit is 50gb for individual files
- Able to accommodate larger file sizes upon request
]

---

# Dryad

.large[
- The Dryad Digital Repository takes data from any field of research, and perform human quality control and assistance of the data
- Can link data with a journal publication, in exchange for a data publishing fee.
]

---

# Linking zenodo and GitHub

.large[

You can also link Zenodo with Github

Zenodo updates with new DOI at every "release" (Helps avoid managing many moving pieces)

# Sharing data as an R package

.large[
e.g., [`nycflights13`](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13), [`eechidna`](https://docs.ropensci.org/eechidna/), [more](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/OZdatasets/)
  ]
  
.pull-left.large[
Pros

- installable
- documentation
- share data cleaning
- great for R users
]

.pull-right.large[

Cons

- Size: ! &gt;= 5Mb (CRAN)
- Doesn't help others outside R
- No structured metadata
]

# Sharing data as an R package

.medium[
- Most (but not all!) data shared as an R package, or with an R package is for teaching purposes
]

--

.medium[
- Sharing data like this allows you to create a "research compendium", with centralised code + paper + computing environment + data.
]

--

.medium[
- See more about this in Karthik Ram's talk: ["How To Make Your Data Analysis Notebooks More Reproducible"](https://github.com/karthik/rstudio2019)

--

.medium[
- Note the directory structure based is on R packages
]

---

# Online "data" journals

.large[
- Provides familiar mechanism for citation
- But journals don't yet have a good way to outline how to share data
- Often looks like a "mini paper" with the methods, and isn't always about the data, but about collection methods.
- Can link to a Zenodo or Dryad repository.
]

---

# Online "data" journals

.large[
Some example data journals:

- [Nature: Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/)
- [Data in Brief](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief)
- [Data](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/data)
- [GigaScience](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience)

# Take homes

.large[
- You don't have to do every single thing to publish your data
- Take small steps - get the data somewhere first, add more detail as you go
]

---

# Future Directions

.large[
- Currently working on a proposal for "datadevtools" - a set of developer tools to facilitate sharing data
- These tools can then be used to assess "shareability" of data
]

# Discussion Questions

.large[
* Do you curate data?
* What are the common painpoints of curating data / collaborating on data?
* How do you manage data releases?
* What are the resistance points to data sharing? 
* Is data shared publicly, is there a process?
* How do you distribute data?
