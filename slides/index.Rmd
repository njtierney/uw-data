# Benefits of Sharing data

`r emo::ji("magnifying")`  Makes work transparent 

`r emo::ji("check")` Increases trust 

`r emo::ji("speaker")` Increases visibility

# Research isn't often shared

It's often really available to the authors


---

# Why not share data?

.large[
There are indeed good reasons to not share data:

1. Privacy concerns (e.g., human subjects, locations of critically endangered species)

1. May put the authors at a competitive disadvantage ( but data can be embargoed for reasonable periods of time)

# Why not share data?

.large[
"If you can't do something right, don't do it"

- This ^^ is wrong - you **can** provide something, even if it is just simulated data.

- Sharing data (in most cases) has a net positive benefit
]

# Rowhani-Farid & Barnett, 2016

.large[
Out of 160 randomly sampled BMJ papers:

- 3 included data in the paper
- 7/157 research articles shared their data sets
- For 21 clinical trials bound by the BMJ data sharing policy, 24% shared data

Authors evaluated reproducibility of 204 papers after clause issued.

# Sharing data?

.large[
Plenty of research says it is important
]

--

.large[
Fata sharing should be FAIR (findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)
]

--

.large[
But, unfortunately, these don't precicely tell you how to share data
]

# Some more barriers to sharing data

.large.pull-left[

Socio-Culture Barriers:

- Misaligned Incentives
- Cultural Norms
- Genomics vs Clinical Trials
- Scooping

]

--

.large.pull-right[

Technological Barriers:

- Where to start?
- Google Drive?
- Dropbox?
- FTP?

]

---

# Another way to think about sharing data

.pull-left[

```{r show-rock, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("img/rock.jpg")
```

]

--

.pull-right[

```{r show-ramp, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("img/ramp-small.jpg")
```

]

???

It should instead be an "on-ramp"

It can feel like a wall or a mountain we need to climb. 

These require special tools and knowledge.

- usually **first format** of data provided before tidying or cleaning. 
- **If the raw data is a practical size to share**, share in folder `data-raw`. 
- Ideally: in form first received, even if binary / proprietary format.

.right-plot[

- Code used to clean and tidy the raw data.

- To create appropriate metadata, we recommend `dataspice` & `codebook`

# Actually sharing the data

.large[
Now that you've created your data folder, you need to **get it somewhere online**

Two options to discuss:

1. Putting the data online
1. Sharing as an R package
]

---
class: inverse, center, middle
# Online repositories: Zenodo & Dryad

---

# Zenodo

.large[
- Launched in 2013 in a joint collaboration between openAIRE and CERN
- Free, archival location to deposit datasets
- File size limit is 50gb for individual files
- Able to accommodate larger file sizes upon request
]

---

# Dryad

.large[
- The Dryad Digital Repository takes data from any field of research, and perform human quality control and assistance of the data
- Can link data with a journal publication, in exchange for a data publishing fee.
]

---

# Linking zenodo and GitHub

.large[

You can also link Zenodo with Github

Zenodo updates with new DOI at every "release" (Helps avoid managing many moving pieces)

See this article on github, [making your code citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) (Thanks to [Arfon Smith](https://www.arfon.org/))

# Sharing data as an R package

.large[
e.g., [`nycflights13`](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13), [`eechidna`](https://docs.ropensci.org/eechidna/), [more](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/OZdatasets/)
  ]
  
.pull-left.large[
Pros

- installable
- documentation
- share data cleaning
- great for R users
]

.pull-right.large[

Cons

- Size: ! >= 5Mb (CRAN)
- Doesn't help others outside R
- No structured metadata
]

---

# Sharing data as an R package

.medium[
- Most (but not all!) data shared as an R package, or with an R package is for teaching purposes
]

--

.medium[
- Sharing data like this allows you to create a "research compendium", with centralised code + paper + computing environment + data.
]

--

.medium[
- See more about this in Karthik Ram's talk: ["How To Make Your Data Analysis Notebooks More Reproducible"](https://github.com/karthik/rstudio2019)
]

--

.medium[
- Note the directory structure based is on R packages
]

---

# Online "data" journals

.large[
- Provides familiar mechanism for citation
- But journals don't yet have a good way to outline how to share data
- Often looks like a "mini paper" with the methods, and isn't always about the data, but about collection methods.
- Can link to a Zenodo or Dryad repository.
]

---

# Online "data" journals

.large[
Some example data journals:

- [Nature: Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/)
- [Data in Brief](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief)
- [Data](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/data)
- [GigaScience](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience)

]

---

# Take homes

.large[
- You don't have to do every single thing to publish your data
- Take small steps - get the data somewhere first, add more detail as you go
]

---

# Future Directions

.large[
- Currently working on a proposal for "datadevtools" - a set of developer tools to facilitate sharing data
- These tools can then be used to assess "shareability" of data
]

---

# Discussion Questions

.large[
* Do you curate data?
* What are the common painpoints of curating data / collaborating on data?
* How do you manage data releases?
* What are the resistance points to data sharing? 
* Is data shared publicly, is there a process?
* How do you distribute data?
